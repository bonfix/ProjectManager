This project is to build a project manager using a laravel and angular while integrating a set of tools provided. Feel free to swap out packages for others but 
remember, you need to explain why you changed them. Create a github repo and push your code there. If you get stuck, feel free to ask. We want you to succeed. At 
the end of each part, please send an email with the link to the branch/tag with the section’s code. Also setup a staged version on heroku or any other cloud 
provider.
